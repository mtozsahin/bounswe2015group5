I am a Undergrad student in Boğaziçi University [Computer Engineering](http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) department. I started programming in high school. Some of my interests are the following :
  * Competitive Programming
  * Algorithm Design
  * Data Structures
  * Writing crawlers/macros/extensions for mundane jobs. (e.g. I am currently working on a python script that sends me an e-mail whenever a new material is posted in a course web page. I am planing to put it on github in the near future)
  * Dystopian Novels
