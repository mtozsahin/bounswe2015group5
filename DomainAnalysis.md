# General Knowledge about our Domain #

> Before I tell about our project's domain, I mention about our project briefly to understand the domain exactly. There are trillions of information on web and some of them are spread out all over the websites. In our project, we will try to relate these informations via our users' help. It will be a website and an Android application which people log in and create content. It also give a chance to relate some contents and rate the accuracy or clarity of the content which is shared by another person.

> At first sight, it could be related with an ordinary forum page in terms of creating content and rating someone's content. However, in addition to this, we will be try to constitute a platform where people relate the content and they may connect the dots. Since it will be on internet and we will make an application, we're looking for our competitors on AppStore, Google Play Store and over internet. Obviously, All of these form a huge environment, however, the important thing is making a difference with our functionality and usability. We will give some examples after our environment.

  * like the idea of sharing interesting contents and following other people's sharing.
  * could be interested in any idea or argument and love to research about their curiosities.
  * have free time since connecting dots about a topic may take some time.

# Environment #
Our project can be used both as web and mobile application.
